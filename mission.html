    <p>Period poverty - the cultural shame associated with menstruation and dire shortage of affordable sanitary products - impacts two in every three women across her country. It prevents girls from attending school, often leaves them vulnerable to early marriage and pregnancy, and results in a suite of health issues when old clothing and mattresses are substituted for sanitary products.</p><br>
    <p>Deeper still is the lingering stigma experienced by women who receive little education about this most natural of processes </p><br>
     <p>While Scotland became the first country in the world to make sanitary products free last November and even the Kenyan Government continues to discuss supplying schools with proper sanitary towels. Last year our foundation partned with Scotland and raised sufficient funds to build dedicated girls' toilets in two high schools (to ensure privacy and better hygiene), and raised $5000 to provide sanitary products for 375 girls in two schools for the first three terms.<p><br>
    <p>We are looking to get more sponsorship so we can discuss other options like tampons and menstrual cups, which are more sustainable and environmentally friendly. Menstruation should not limit girls and be a barrier to them achieving their goals in life. And no-one should take advantage of them for that. Information is power and I want to ensure that girls get the correct information and support they need.</p><br>
